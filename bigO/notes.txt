--- Constants do NOT Matter ---
O(12) -> O(1)
O(1212) -> O(1)
O(2n) -> O(n)
O(n/2) -> O(n)
O(13n^2) -> O(n ^ 2)

--- Smaller Terms do NOT Matter ---
O(n^2 + 13n + 8) -> O(n^2)


--- Why we simplify Big O ---
Big O only cares about worst case scenarios and general trends as N approceaches infinity

--- New Terms ---

O(1) -> Constant Time 
O(n) -> Linear Time
O(n ^ 2) -> Quadratic Time
